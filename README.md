### 5- order_products 

because the relation between order and products are many to many
(any product can be in different orders and any order can have many products)
we have to make a separate table for this relation

| COLUMN        | TYPE    | CONSTRAINTS        | DESCRIPTION                                                 |

| order_id      | integer | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | refers to the order                                         |
| product_id    | integer | NOT NULL           | refers to the product in this order                         |
| quantity      | integer | NOT NULL  >=0      | the quantity of this product in this order                  |
| product_price | integer | NOT NULL           | the price of the product the moment the user made the order |

* when an order or product is deleted, the associated rows in the order_products table are deleted automatically
